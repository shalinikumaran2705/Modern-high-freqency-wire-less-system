Microstrip Lines: The Backbone of Modern High-Frequency Wireless Systems
---
##1. Introduction

From smartphones and Wi-Fi routers to RADAR systems and satellites, every modern wireless device relies on tiny copper traces printed on PCB boards called microstrip lines. These lines guide high-frequency signals (MHz–GHz) with minimal distortion.  Unlike normal copper wires, microstrip lines must manage effects like impedance mismatch, signal reflection, dielectric loss, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) — especially in fast digital and RF systems.
